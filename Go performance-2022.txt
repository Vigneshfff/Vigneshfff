JE Rationalization Data Automation:

The below powerBi Report Has been implemented for month on month journal count with categories and analyzing the 
percentage of business growth with the powerBi data visualization chart.This report is having more visuals and tabs to understand the
data and count and percentage of growth on month by month on an incremental basis.And earlier the report designed 
with manual data files uploada as an excel.Now we have automated the the process to load the data from 
GCP(Google Cloud Platform) with uploading the files into the tables using the cloud storage bucket.
So this will avoids the manual file uploads and errors in the data file.
Then the ultimate objective of the below report automation is reduction of manual work,
time savings in the data upload part and taking less refresh time in powerBi service with accurate data.

SLA KPI Report(Service Level Agreement):

Service level agreement PowerBi report includes both the powerBi design and organising the data in GCP.
The below report we have designed as per the client requirent that we have designed with ten metrics which 
can be used to analyze the performance,time,efficiency,accuracy,reduction level.


Dynamic Risk Scoring monthly refresh:

The dynamic risk scoring powerBi report enhancement as per the client requirement of refreshing the 
month on month data to analyze the performance.And the data validation needs to be done for the given report 
 after the refresh of the powerBi.For SLA KPI and dynamic risk scoring we have used separate files 
with column difference from blacline line report.To avoid the time consumption and repetition of work we have implemented
 the python function to pull the file from blackline for both the reports with applying different filters in the stored procedure.
